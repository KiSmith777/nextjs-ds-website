                            Customized smart contract creation allows catering to the projectâ€™s specific needs, tailoring every aspect. 
                            This customization provides greater control over your project and ensures better security by not having unneeded functions and parameters. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Typical smart contracts made include but are not limited to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tokens</li>
                            <li>NFT's</li>
                            <li>dApp's</li>
                        </ul></p>
                        <p>
                            Gone are the days of getting cookie-cutter contracts that lack the specific functions your team wants.
