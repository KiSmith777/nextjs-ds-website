It will do this by providing a platform to highlight vetted projects in addition to various products and services for both DeFi developers and users as well as acquiring strategic partnerships and affiliations who support the same vision/mission. \n\nThis ecosystem of products and services is power by Skeptic Token (SKP) which is a multi-use, liquidity backed token with a unique deflationary mechanism that is not volume dependent which we call the \"Burn Fund\"."
