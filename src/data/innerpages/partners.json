Providing this level of detail on DeFi projects can help reduce fraud while increasing security and peace of mind for those looking to invest their hard-earned money.\n\nIf you are a project team member and would like to apply to have the project vetted by DeFi Skeptic, you can do so on the Get Vetted page.\n\nDeFi projects that have passed the vetting process are listed in the DeFi Skeptic Vetted Projects page."
