To understand the mission behind DeFi Skeptic, you have to understand where it originated.

The founder, Chris, has been an avid investor in both traditional and crypto markets. The lack of information in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space and the abundance of malicious individuals looking to scam people caused Chris to create a Discord chatroom where he was cataloging information for his own use, information he spent hours collecting. The purpose of this information was to build a profile on specific projects, a means of reducing his own risk exposure through abundance of information. The idea was the more information you have, the more educated your decision will be. Chris began inviting friends to the chatroom who repeatedly expressed how valuable the information was for them personally. This seeded the idea…why not make this public?
An idea is born…

Throughout Chris’ digital journey he met Joe, Kieran and Jake. All bring something unique to the table.

· Joe is a human factors engineer and UX designer with a passion for bettering businesses and increasing the experience the customer has.

· Kieran is an aspiring cyber security professional with a broad understanding of programing and web creation. Kieran has a strong desire to help those interested in crypto currency become more educated so they can remain safe in the crypto space.

· Jake brings experience in customer/community relations and management. During Jake’s journey, he has realized communication is a key component to any organizations success. His goal is to ensure DeFi Skeptic promotes synergy amongst its user base.

Chris met all of these individuals separately and got to know each one of them personally. When the time came to launch the DeFi Skeptic platform, these individuals were the first people he asked to assist. DeFi Skeptic initially started out with the idea of being a vetting platform for DeFi projects, but the team soon realized they could offer a lot more.
Building a full service platform…

DeFi Skeptic was founded when a gap was identified between legitimate projects and DeFi users. In 2021 alone, malicious actors stole over $10 billion from DeFi users through various scams, vulnerabilities, and exploits. This necessity is why we created DeFi Skeptic.

DeFi Skeptic is a platform that seeks to reduce fraud while increasing transparency and accuracy of information in the DeFi space. It will do this by providing a platform to highlight vetted projects in addition to various products and services for both DeFi developers and users as well as acquiring strategic partnerships and affiliations who support the same vision/mission.

This ecosystem of products and services is powered by Skeptic Token (SKP) which is a multi-use, liquidity backed token with a unique deflationary mechanism that is not volume dependent which we call the “Burn Fund”.
